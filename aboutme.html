            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>
             My name is Kyan Marley. I am a sophomore at Palm Desert High School. 
             This year I have decided what colleges I'm interested in going to so I have to acquire as many skills as I can and that I have to challenge myself more these next three years. 
             This is my first year taking computer science and it is a very fun class but you have to pay more attention in this class compared to other electives. 
             Additionally, I am taking Spanish because living in a Hispanic household isn't easy when I don't know much Spanish. 
             Therefore Spanish is a hard but fun class for me. Lastly, the path I have chosen to take for my life is becoming a medical scientist so I have many more years of school ahead of me.
