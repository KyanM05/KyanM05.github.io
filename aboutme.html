            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>
             My name is Kyan Marley. I am a sophomore at Palm Desert High School. 
             This year I have decided what colleges I'm interested in going to so I have to acquire as many skills as I can and that I have to challenge myself more these next three years. 
             This is my first year taking computer science and it is a very fun class but you have to pay more attention in this class compared to other electives. 
             Additionally, I am taking Spanish because living in a Hispanic household isn't easy when I don't know much Spanish. 
             Therefore Spanish is a hard but fun class for me. Lastly, the path I have chosen to take for my life is becoming a medical scientist so I have many more years of school ahead of me.
            </p>

            <h3>More About me</h3>
            I enjoy learning about new things that interest me and make me question why I am learning it and what it means to gain the knowledge. 
            When it comes to math or science, I usually excell in these topics because I find myself out of class still learning about these things and questioning what they mean and do.
            I work as hard as I can for the topics I love and alwyas make sure to go above and beyond while not trying too much and limiting myself to do what I think is best. 
            <p>

            <h3>Personal Qualities</h3>
            <p>
             I have learned to be smart about the decisions I make before taking them. To read all possible ways and outcomes of a situation before approaching it and taking the time to learn in the process.
             I love to interact with those who have the same ideas and even if I meet someone with oppisite ideas I always hear both sides of the story before making my decision on what I believe. 
             Talking with people and making friends is something I am proud of doing and working well with others is a big key role in my life.
